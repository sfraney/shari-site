Wilderness Pathfinder Connections envisions a world where women veterans are recognized as leaders in nature-based healing and self-generated ceremony. Through education, resources, and a strong web of guides and guides-in-training, we cultivate long-term change to cultivate cultural and community renewal. We ensure that diverse traditions are honored, knowledge is shared with integrity, and future generations have access to these transformative practices. By fostering personal growth, collective healing, and new pathways of renewal, we create lasting change for individuals and communities alike.
