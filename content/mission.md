Wilderness Pathfinder Connections is a nonprofit dedicated to empowering women veterans to become Rite of Passage Wilderness Guides, expanding access to nature-based healing, self-generated ceremony, and a deep connection to the land. We provide funding, education, and resources to remove systemic barriers and ensure that diverse voices, experiences, and traditions are honored. By cultivating a supportive web of guides and guides-in-training, we foster the creation of pathways for personal transformation, cultural renewal, and collective healing.
